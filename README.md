A logger that prints all messages with a readable output format.

The output format is based on the format used by [Supervisord](http://supervisord.org/).

Usage
-----

```rust
use simple_logger::SimpleLogger;

fn main() {
    SimpleLogger::new().init().unwrap();

    log::warn!("This is an example message.");
}
```

This outputs:

```
2015-02-24 01:05:20 WARN [logging_example] This is an example message.
```

You can run the above example with:

```bash
cargo run --example init
```

Coloured output and timestamps will be enabled by default. You can remove these
features and their respective dependencies by disabling all features in your
`Cargo.toml`.

```
[dependencies.simple_logger]
default-features = false
```

To include the `timestamps` feature, but not the `colors` feature:

```
[dependencies.simple_logger]
default-features = false
features = ["timestamps"]
```

To include the `colors` feature, but not the `timestamps` feature:

```
[dependencies.simple_logger]
default-features = false
features = ["colors"]
```

To include the name of the thread logging enable the `threadid` feature:

```
[dependencies.simple_logger]
features = ["threadid"]
```

To direct logging output to `stderr` use the `stderr` feature:

```
[dependencies.simple_logger]
features = ["stderr"]
```

This can be combined with any other feature.
